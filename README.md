# Solutions to problems from /Digital Dice/
Paul Nahin has written a wonderful collection of problems. All can be solved with a RNG and some head scratching. Nahin's explores the problems in depth and presents running Matlab code for all the problems.

The code here is written in Python 3 using the built-in library /random/ and also /numpy/ and /matplotlib/ for plotting.
